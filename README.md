Predicting Doctor Fees
</p>

## Medcos - Doctor Consultation Fees Prediction Project
Collaborated on a team project to deploy a machine learning model for predicting doctor consultation fees using data scraped from Practo.

## Dataset
Scraped doctor consultation fee data from Practo using Python and Beautiful Soup. The data included various factors such as doctor's qualification, experience, location, and ratings.

## Development Process
Preprocessed the data using Python and selected the best machine learning algorithm based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The selected model was then integrated into a Flask application and saved as a pickle file.

## Webpage Design [See Here](https://medcos.vercel.app/)
Designed a clean and user-friendly webpage using HTML, CSS, and Adobe Illustrator. The webpage allowed users to input the necessary features such as location, doctor's qualification, experience, and ratings, and get predicted consultation fees.

## Conclusion
Predictions were made based on the factors influencing doctor consultation fees in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. Our model can be used by patients to estimate the consultation fees before visiting the doctor, which can help them make informed decisions.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Beautiful Soup
Flask
Scikit-Learn
HTML
CSS
Adobe Illustrator

## How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine
Install the required dependencies
Run the Python script to scrape data from Practo
Preprocess the data using Python
Train and save the machine learning model as a pickle file
Integrate the model into a Flask application
Design a webpage using HTML, CSS, and Adobe Illustrator
Run the Flask application to view the webpage

## Future Work
In the future, we plan to expand our analysis to include more locations and factors influencing consultation fees. We also plan to improve the model's accuracy and incorporate user feedback to make the webpage more user-friendly.
